            This website is designed to be a repository for any and all characters used in table-top roll playing games.
            I have found that over the years I have had folder fill up with all the different characters that I have made
            over the years and whenever I want to revisit or look over an old character I find it impossible to actually
            find it in the piles of paper. The hope of this website is to create an easy and convenient way for anyone to
            keep track of their various characters.
        </p>
